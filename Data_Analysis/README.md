This folder contains the analysis codes for the data from the experiment with within-subject comparsions.

The analyses of performance of free recall (Day 1) and recognition (Day 2) are separated in different scripts. 

Several functions written by Linfeng previously, and the ROC Toolbox (Koen et al., 2016) developed by the Yonelinas Lab (UC Davis) were used.

SS2_Preprocessing.m is used to transform the data into the format required by the ROC Toolbox.

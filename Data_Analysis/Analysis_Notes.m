%% This part is excluded in the second design -- no need to worry about it
% For items judged old (confidence rating of 4, 5, or 6) compute % correct (exact value) and % correct (general value level; collapsing 1/2/3 into "low" and 10/11/12 into "high") for HV and LV items 
% And then break down the above summaries for each recognition confidence level. [goal is to see if '6' responses have the highest value recollection, followed by '5' responses, etc.]

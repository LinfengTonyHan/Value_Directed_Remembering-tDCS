# Value_Directed_Remembering-tDCS

This repository contains the experiment and data analysis codes written by Linfeng Han (Tony) for the project **Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation of Ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex on Value-Incentivized Modulation of Memory Encoding**.

Direct supervisor: Dr. Jesse Rissman, Dept. of Psychology, UCLA.

The ***Experiment_Programs*** folder contains the scripts written for the experimental sessions (written in MATLAB Psychtoolbox). Note that all scripts were not written in the **function** format because global variables do not work fine with MATLAB R2012b.  
The ***Data_Analysis*** folder contains the analysis codes for the data. We used the ROC Toolbox (Koen et al., 2016) to accomplish the ROC analysis.
